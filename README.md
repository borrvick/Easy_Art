# Easy_Art
This was a project for CIS270_Client_Side_Web_Programming. The purpose is to create a canvas and draw an selected amount of circles or squares depending on the choice of the user. The user can also use their mouse to free hand draw or use the keys to replicated an etch-sketch type of experience.
